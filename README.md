## Tutorials

1. Download appropriate network latency data sets and put it under data-set/ folder. The data file contain a (symmetric) matrix in plain text that is loadable by MATLAB.

2. Compile the cpp files under robust-ncs/ using MATLAB MEX (MATLAB 2010a or above should work).

3. cd robust-ncs, then run test_ncs.m with MATLAB.
